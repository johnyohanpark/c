 * k&r exercise 1-21 p.34 Write a program "entab" that replaces strings of blanks by
 * the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same
 * tab stops as for "detab". When either a tab or single blank would suffice to reach
 * a tab stop, which should be given preference?
